    <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Season the meat with the Kosher salt and ground pepper on all sides</li>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large 7 quart Dutch oven over medium high heat.

        Remove<br> the roast and set aside. Make sure to leave the brown bits on the bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li>Reduce to medium heat. Add the onions and saute until they start to brown,<br>
    about 3 minutes, scraping the bottom and the sides of the pot to deglaze the <br>
    brown bits with the moisture from the onions. Add minced garlic and cook until <br>
    fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, fresh thyme sprigs,<br>
    fresh rosemary sprigs, and bay leaves. Stir until combined and bring to a low boil.</li>
    <li>Return the seared meat back to the pot, the beef should be half covered by<br>
    the liquid, if not, add more beef broth as needed. cover and bake for 1.5 hours.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and add the chopped carrots and potatoes, check and adjust the<br>
    seasoning at this time. Return to oven and cook for 2 hours more or until the meat<br>
    is fork tender and falls apart, and the vegetables are tender.</li>
    <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
